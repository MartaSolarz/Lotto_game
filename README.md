##### 1. General information about the lotto game in Poland. #####

Lotto is the oldest and most popular number game in Poland. The first draw took place on January 27, 1957. The game is based on selecting six numbers from a pool of 1 to 49. There are many versions of the above game. The following description and code are for the base, most classic version of the game. So far, the highest prize was 36726210.2 PLN and took place on March 16, 2017.

##### 2. The probability of hitting the Lotto. #####

* hit 0 numbers: 43.6%
* hit 1 number: 41.3%
* hit 2 numbers: 13.2%
* hit 3 numbers: 1.77%
* hit 4 numbers: 0.097%
* hit 5 numbers: 0.0018%
* hit 6 numbers: 0.0000072%

##### 3. The amount won and the number of hits. #####

In general, the winnings depend on the amount of the lotto accumulation and the amount allocated to the winning.

* hit 3 numbers: 24 PLN;
* hit 4 numbers: an average of 13% of the amount spent on winning (several hundred PLN);
* hit 5 numbers: 8% of the amount spent on winning (several thousand PLN);
* hit 6 numbers: 43% of the amount spent on winning (milion PLN or more).

##### 4. How the code should work? #####

The task to be performed during the programming classes was to write a code that:
* implements a lotto game using the random module;
* will allow the user to bet on their own numbers;
* will inform the user how many numbers it has hit.

Moreover, I also entered the expected amount of winnings into the code.

##### 5. Python modules used. #####

* random
